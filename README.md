# Maximum Xor with Prefix and Suffix
This is my attempt to solve the following question:

>Given `N` numbers as an array, find a prefix array and a suffix array, in which we can get the maximum **XOR value**, using all the numbers in both arrays.
>The `prefix[0, l]` and `suffix[r, n - 1]` do not intersect, i.e. `(l < r)`, and they can be empty.
>
>The range of `N` is `(1 <= N <= 100000)`. The range of the input numbers is `(0 <= ai <= 1e12)`.
